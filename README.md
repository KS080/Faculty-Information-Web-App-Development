# Flask Web App for Faculty Details

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a Flask-based web application to scrape and display information about UIC MSCS faculty. It extracts faculty names, emails, office locations, and teaching schedules using Beautiful Soup and stores this data in a JSON file. Users can search for faculty or classes through a web interface that dynamically presents the information.

## Features
- **Data Scraping:** Utilizes Beautiful Soup for efficient extraction of faculty information from web pages.
- **Data Storage:** Saves scraped data in a structured JSON file for easy access and manipulation.
- **Search Functionality:** Allows users to search for specific faculty members or classes, displaying relevant information.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Flask app with `python app.py` to start the web server.

## Usage
Navigate to the web app's URL and use the search bar to find information on faculty or classes. The results will be displayed on the web page.
